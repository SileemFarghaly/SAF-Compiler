SAF-Compiler

A quick and dirty little compiler 
Licensed under CRAPL (see CRAPL-LICENSE)
Compiled with MASM
This project is AS-IS, there are many problems with it that I have not gotten around to fixing.

USEAGE:
The compiler will read from CODE.txt and output PROG1.COM

Syntax Example: 
var int Q .eql 7
var int R .eql 8
var int S .eql 0
add Q,R giving S
var int A .eql 2
var int B .eql 1
var int C .eql 0
add A,B giving C
